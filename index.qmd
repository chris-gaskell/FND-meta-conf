## Introduction / Aim

-   **Functional / Dissociative Seizures (FDS)**: an involuntary response to internal or external triggers associated with dysfunctional emotion regulation
-   Psychological tretaments highly recommended. Common treatments include: **CBT, Psychodynamic Therapy, ACT**
-   **Current uncertainties**:
    -   **How** effective?
    -   Under **what** conditions?
    -   Are **improvements** durable
    -   **Which** type of outcome responds is most sensitive to change
-   We attempted to answer each of these using a series of meta-analytic investigations.

### Methods

-   2 x systematic searches (4 databases)
-   All studies reporting outcomes for a psychological intervention.
-   **Seizure** outcomes, **non-seizure** outcomes
-   A series of multi-variate meta-analyses:
    -   Treatment effects
    -   Follow up effects

### Results

-   44 studies, N = 1300
-   135 seizure, 171 non-seizure
-   Seizure improvement = 66% (75% at follow up).
-   Seizure freedom = 40% (36% at follow up).
-   Moderate size effects (*d* = .51) across non seizure outcomes.
-   Medium / High risk of bias across studies.
-   Limited evidence for specific moderator variables.

## Main Highlights

-   Psychological treatments **improve** seizure and non-seizure outcomes
-   Improvements appear **durable**.

### Limitations

  -   Meta-analysis is observational. **Does not** suppose causality
  -   High or medium bias risk across studies.

### Future Directions
  -   Further experimental evidence required
  -   Reporting standards for measurement and reporting of seizure outcomes required.
  -   **Consensus** on key outcomes in FDS required to guide future RCTs.
