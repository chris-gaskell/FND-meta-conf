## Introduction / Aim

-   **Functional / Dissociative Seizures (FDS)** involuntary response to internal or external triggers associated with dysfunctional emotion regulation.
-   Psychological tretaments highly recommended. Common treatments include: **CBT, Psychodynamic Therapy, ACT**.
-   **Current uncertainties**:
    -   **How** effective?
    -   Under **what** conditions?
    -   Are **improvements** durable
    -   **Which** type of outcome responds is most sensitive to change
-   We attempted to answer these questions using a series of meta-analytic investigations.

### Methods

-   2 x systematic searches (4 databases)
-   All studies reporting outcomes for a psychological intervention.
-   Seizure outcomes, non-seizure outcomes
-   A series of multi-variate meta-analyses:
    -   Treatment effects
    -   Follow up effects

### Results

-   Systematic Search identified 44 studies
    -   171 non-seizure; 135 seizure; N = 1300.
-   Seizure improvement = 66% (75% at follow up).
-   Seizure freedom = 40% (36% at follow up).
-   Moderate size effects (*d* = .51) across a range of non seizure outcomes.
-   Medium / High risk of bias across the majority of included studies.
-   Limited evidence for specific moderator variables.

## Conclusions

-   Psychological treatments **improve** seizure and non-seizure outcomes
-   Improvements appear **durable**
-   **Limitations**:
    -   Meta-analysis is observational - does not suppose causality
    -   High or medium bias risk across studies; "low" quality per GRADE criteria
-   **Future Directions**:
    -   Further experimental evidence required
    -   Need for research on **durability** of psychological treatment benefits
